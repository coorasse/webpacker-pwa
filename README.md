# Webpacker Progressive Web App

Webpacker does not support Progressive Web Apps? Here is the solution for you.

This repository consists of two parts: an npm package and a ruby gem which add customizations on 
the top of the standard Rails Webpacker configuration and allow you to start
writing a Progressive Rails App!

Is meant as a quick tool that you can use to get it working today, 
while we wait for the necessary changes to be introduced and approved on Webpacker itself. 
It follows the guide written about The Progressive Rails App.

Please check the two folders for a detailed introduction.
